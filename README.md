# 🚗 Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Analysis & Growth Insights

This repository contains a **comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Electric Vehicle (EV) sales data**, focusing on **market trends, growth rates, and yearly adoption patterns**.  
The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and multiple curated datasets to derive meaningful insights into the EV market.

The project emphasizes **data-driven reasoning, visualization, and interpretability** rather than black-box prediction.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze EV sales data from multiple perspectives
- Study **year-wise sales trends**
- Examine **growth rate patterns** in EV adoption
- Perform structured **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- Summarize insights through a consolidated visual dashboard

---

## 📂 Datasets Used

The analysis is based on the following datasets:

- **Enhanced EV Dataset**
  - Contains enriched EV sales and categorical information
- **Growth Rate Analysis Dataset**
  - Focuses on EV sales growth metrics
- **Yearly Sales Trend Dataset**
  - Captures year-wise EV adoption patterns

All datasets are loaded from a Kaggle data source and processed independently before combined analysis.
